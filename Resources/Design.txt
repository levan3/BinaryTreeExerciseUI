My Application

The left-hand side VBox contains: 

Load File button: using a prompt file chooser, allow users to choose files from their computer.
In Order button: print names based on BST depth first, in order.
Pre Order button: print names based on BST depth first, pre order.
Post Order button: print names based on BST Breadth First.
Text Field: Search for Names in File, based on First, Last, Length of First Name or Length of Last Name. 
Decision can be chosen from the choice box below the Text Field.
Clear Pane: Clear everything on the grid.
Clear Data: Delete the binary tree, in case user wants to reload a different file.

I also includes 2 hyperlinks to load 2 given files on ecs webpage: mswdev.csv and more_names.csv. These 
hyperlinks load the files onto the programs. Users can then choose to sort the name in the order they want.
